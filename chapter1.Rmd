+ [**Introduction to Open Data Science**](https://mooc.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=158#section-0)

[R markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) will be used to reproduce the analysis, which is of great importance in science. Eventually, we will combine all the individual MarkDown files together as a single [work diary](https://qingliguo.github.io/IODS-project/). Doesn't it sound amazing? So let's gooooo!
